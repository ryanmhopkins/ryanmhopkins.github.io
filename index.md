<div class="lead pretty-links">
  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan â€” a business analyst and full stack developer (currently available for projects) with a passion for solving complex problems through data, code, and creativity. By day, I dive deep into analytics and build end-to-end solutions that bridge business needs with technical execution. By night, youâ€™ll find me tinkering with AI projects, exploring the possibilities of machine intelligence.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m an ultrarunner and fitness junkie who thrives on endurance, discipline, and pushing limits â€” both on the trails and in my work.
